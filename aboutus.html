<p>Dusty Buns Bistro is a local restaurant and food truck business that prides itself on serving fresh, local, organic food to the communities of California since 2009. Meet the Dusty Buns team. We are Dustin &amp; Kristin Stewart- The founders and Chefs behind Dusty Buns. Born on opposite sides of the country but drawn together like the perfect recipe with our love for each other and the culinary arts. We became a part of the San Francisco, Potrero Hill community, while attending the Le Cordon Bleu Culinary Academy &amp; graduating together with Cum Laude honors. While Kristin’s hometown offered a direct connection to the best farmers and had a historic acceptance of taco trucks, Fresno quickly became the home &amp; local hub for the “Farm to Bun” movement. With organic growth planned for the Central Valley and Bay Area, 2014 was the year to return to SF with a citrus colored Bistro Bus headed straight toward the most recent venture- a Brick-&-Mortar Bistro in San Francisco’s Design District. Together we strive to build a brand that celebrates comfort food and the importance of sustainability. California is our culinary destination as ALL of the ingredients used at Dusty Buns are grown and produced in this great state! Feel good after filling up on fresh, local, seasonal dishes at your neighborhood bistro, Dusty Buns!</p>
